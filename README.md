# Feature_engineering_Using_EDA
This project demonstrates how Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can be combined with Feature Engineering to improve the performance of machine learning models. Using a real-world dataset, we explore data distributions, handle missing values, detect outliers, and create new meaningful features that significantly enhance model accuracy. This model is also very useful to learn the exploratory Data analysis
